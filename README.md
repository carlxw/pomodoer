> All-in-one (Todo list, pomodoro timer, Spotify music player) web application built to combat student procrastination and bolster academic efficiency

## Project Features
* Notion-inspired to-do list
* Pomodoro timer with pre-configured time presets, and counts the number of study sessions the user has undergone
* Spotify music player controller capable of play/pausing, track control, and volume control, connected directly to Spotify API
* Aesthetic wallpapers on Spotify connection to relax the brain when studying (wallpapers are not owned, and are used under free-use policy)

## How to Use
1. Write down study goals in the todo list
1. Log into Spotify music player
1. Start the pomodoro timer
1. Write down any break ideas once it comes up
1. Repeat until the study session concludes

## Project Roadmap
- [ ] Support different viewports for tablet/mobile users
- [ ] Move way from `localStorage` to favour a server-side storage system
- [ ] Implement more user configurable settings such as timer durations, custom-loaded wallpapers, etc.
- [ ] Implement subtasks for the to-do list
- [ ] Design a focus mode where the user cannot access non-whitelisted tabs when under a study session
- [ ] Rescript the timer (fix problems when spamming start/stop, move away from JS timeout/interval features)
- [ ] Open more sources for audio stremaing (i.e., YouTube lofi livestream/radios)
